# MixStick-Arcade-Controller
Compact, universal 12-button WASD layout USB arcade controller. Enclosure design files are available to remix/ suite whatever application you need. A hybrid of a mechanical keyboard and budget arcade fight stick, but forced into the constraints of economical parts and versatility. Unlike all the dedicated things it’s inspired by, it doesn’t do anything particularly well, but at the cost of parts I can confidently say it’s punches above it weight combared to the $250+ mixbox-like alternatives. Can also be a macro keyboard when paird with AntiMicroX.

The circuit board is discrete input (not a row column matrix) arduino pro micro arcade controller. Or just a generic USB HID game controller with a modular enclosure. The circuit is designed as pin to pin compatible with the open source and awesome daemon byte arcade encoder firmware by MickGyver. I’ve added RGB leds for clout. Set your IDE to an Arduino Leonardo or Pro Micro, and upload MickGyver Firmware. Plug this into a Mac or PC and that’s it. You’ve got a nice compact gaming controller with more buttons than you need.  But there’s more to get from this.
